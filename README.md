This plugin was created based on anime Seven Deadly Sins.
This a test project of Minecraft plugin.
The plugin has two funcs. 

First func: Full Counter.
  Full Counter - that is one of more abilities, hero - Meliodas's, which allows to reflect the enemy's attack in double power.
  The ability's 'Full Counter' owns an anime's main hero - Meliodas.
  I wanted to create this ability in Minecraft, but I'm understood that is unreal. I have to thought.. And I had an idea! The ability 'Full Counter' have a mini-ability 'Revening Counter" and I wanted to create her.
